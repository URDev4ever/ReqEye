# ReqEye
ReqEye is a CLI assistant for HTTP request analysis, designed to help security researchers, bug bounty hunters, and pentesters identify high‑value entry points worth manual testing.  It does not scan targets, send traffic, or claim vulnerabilities. ReqEye focuses on where to look, not on making assumptions.
